[Chi Ching Cheng]
Role(s): Documentation lead, Contributor (DNA2), Debugging and testing DNA 1, reviewing teammates' work and provide feedback
Specific Contributions:
    - Documentation: Created and maintained CONTRIBUTIONS.md, summarising input of our team. Created and organised README.md. Improved formatting of the md files. 
    - Code contributor: Contributed to implementation of DNA Task2. Before doing DNA task2, I run through DNA task1 and assisted in debugging when necessary. 
    - Debugging: Tested both DNA task 1 and 2. Checking if the output match what we expected and ensure the scripts are free of errors. 
    - Collaboration: provide peer feedback to other teammates, discuss in group, helping each other out, and ensuring all CW have been finished. 
Key commits: Added README.md, CONTRIBUTIONS.md files, debugged and ensured smooth running of DNA task1 and contributed to coding and testing in DNA task2.

[Collaboration Process]
Meeting Schedule: We usually met once a week online for group work and we communicated via Whatsapp (mainly for discussion, helping each other and for daily communication)

Work Distribution Strategy: There are three tasks and we have four people in group so Anaga, CCC and Yian took responsibility for 1 task based on their interests. Zhou, who has strong technical skills, set up the GitHub repository, created the branches for each task and performed final check. This division allowed each member to work independently and contributing to the final output.

Key Decisions: We decided to create separate branches (dna, oal) for each major task before merging into the main branch. This helped prevent merge conflict while each teammates are working in the same repository and ensured the code can be tested before the integration for submission. 

Challenges and Solutions: At the beginning, the team was unfamiliar with collaborative workflows on GitHub and do not know how it can work. Through discussion and teamwork, teammates helped each other understand the process and workflow so everyone was happy collaborating and contributing effectively.

[Testing and Quality Assurance]
    - each of us tested our own code individually before pushing to the corresponding branches. 
    - teammates tested one another's work before continue working on the previous one
    - Verifications and testing were done after individual branches were merged into the main one. 
    - finally, before Zhou did the final push, he tested everything.
