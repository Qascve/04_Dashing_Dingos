# CW3 GroupWork 2

## Overview
This coursework of GroupWork 2 (CW4), where our team collaborated to finish coding solutions for 2 main tasks: Florida and PP_Regress_locs. This coursework allowed us to perform a permeatation test to assess the significance of the correlation for temperature data, aswell as a linear regression to understand the location-specific relationships in predator-prey mass dynamics.
