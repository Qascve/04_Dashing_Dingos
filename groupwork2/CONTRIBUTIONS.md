## Collaboration Process

**Meeting Schedule:**  
- Met online once a week for group work.  
- Daily communication via WhatsApp for discussion and support.  

**Work Distribution Strategy:**  
- Three tasks were divided among four members based on interests:  
  - Anaga, CCC, and Yian took responsibility for one task each.  
  - Zhou handled technical setup, repository management, and final integration.  

**Key Decisions:**  
- Created separate branches (`dna`, `oak`) for each major task before merging into `main`.  
- Ensured each member could work independently and test code before integration.  

**Challenges and Solutions:**  
- Initially, the team was unfamiliar with GitHub collaborative workflows.  
- Teammates helped each other understand processes, enabling effective collaboration.
